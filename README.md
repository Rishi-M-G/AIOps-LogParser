# AIOps-LogParser
This repository is a part of COEN691 - Artificial Intelligence for Software Systems Operations course instructed by Professor Wahab Hamou-Lhadj, PhD.

In this study, we replicated a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for log parsing. To verify the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a log parsing tool, we are going to compare the results from ChatGPT with two other state-of-the-art log parsing tools, AEL and Drain.


## AEL


Run the following scripts to execute the benchmark for AEL:

```
python benchmark.py
```

### Benchmark

Running the benchmark script on Loghub_2k datasets, you could obtain the following results.
